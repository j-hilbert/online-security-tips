                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-indigo-700">1. Use Strong, Unique Passwords</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">
                        Never reuse passwords. Use a reputable password manager to generate and store complex, unique passwords
                        for each of your accounts.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2 text-gray-800">Why?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">
                        The reason having a unique password for every account is so important is simple: You have no way of knowing how
                        securely your account information is being protected when it is stored by a third party. You may use a very strong
                        password, but if you use it on all of your accounts, then if any vendor gets compromised, ALL of your accounts
                        are compromised. Enormous lists of leaked credentials are available online for bad actors to utilize. Don't let
                        the bad security practices of the gossip forum you joined in 2003 be the reason your bank account gets drained today.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-3">
                        Good passwords are hard to guess and not used anywhere else. The best passwords are long, random text
                        strings containing upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters. More than just being
                        hard to guess, these long, random, complex passwords also take a long time to brute force, and bad actors
                        attempting to do so are more likely to be detected in the process. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-3">
                        As humans, we are not good at remembering
                        large quantities of random passwords. Since you should be using a unique password for every account, managing
                        this yourself will get cumbersome very quickly. Use a password manager. They're worth every penny you might
                        spend on them, and if you're a bit more techy, you can host your own for free.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2 text-gray-800">Which one should I choose?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">
                        A good password manager stores only encrypted data, has abundant security mechanisms available to secure your personal
                        information, and offers browser extensions and mobile apps that you can use to fill login credentials automatically as
                        you need them. The more convenient it is to use, the more likely you are to use it. Because it allows access to ALL
                        of your accounts, it is especially important that you secure it well. Enable multi-factor authentication at the very
                        least. More on that to come.

                            limited to, a history of data breaches, unencrypted data exposure, questionable transparency, third-party audit
                            concerns, and reports of crypto currency theft due to cracked user vaults exposing users' private keys.

                        If you're not using a password manager, passphrases offer better security than passwords and are still easy to
                        remember. While I wouldn't recommend using this one, "My password is P@ssword One Two Three!" is significantly
                        more secure than "P@ssword123" but is just as easy to remember.

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-indigo-700">2. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">
                        Also called <strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</strong>, especially if more than two pieces of evidence are required to log in.
                        This provides an extra layer of security to your accounts. Even if your password is stolen, 2FA/MFA makes unauthorized access 
                        significantly harder.  This is because in addition to your password, bad actors need something you have (a security
                        token, your phone, or a hardware key) or are (such as biometric data like your fingerprint or facial recognition). While
                        usually not required, most online services offer multi-factor authentication if you dig into your profile settings.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2 text-gray-800">Example:</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">
                        Any time you've entered your username and password into a website and were then prompted for a code that was emailed or sent
                        to your registered phone number via SMS, you were using multi-factor authentication. <br>First, you provided something you knew: the
                        username and password required to log in. <br>Second, you provided something you have: in this case access to your phone or email.
                        <br>Once both pieces of evidence were confirmed, you gained access to the service using your account. If a bad actor had the
                        password to your bank account, they wouldn't be able to log into without also having access to your email. If you're using
                        the same or a similar password for both accounts, however, then they may have access to both and can circumvent your added
                        security. Do not reuse passwords.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2 text-gray-800">What are my options?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">
                        You have several different options, but they are not all created equal. At a high level, there are four types of MFA:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-3 space-y-2">
                        <li>
                            <strong>Knowledge-based authentication:</strong> This type of MFA relies on something you know, such as a password, PIN, or the answer to a security question.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Possession-based authentication:</strong> This factor involves something you have, like a smartphone, physical security key, or smart card.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Inherence-based authentication:</strong> Also known as biometric authentication, this type uses something you are, such as your fingerprint, facial recognition, or iris scan.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Location-based authentication:</strong> This type of MFA considers the user's physical location when granting access. For example, an employee might only be allowed to access certain resources when connected to the company's secure Wi-Fi network.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-3">
                        With that said, possession-based authentication is often the most secure. SMS and email are the least secure.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-3">
                        SMS - text messages - are not considered secure as your carrier SIM card can be spoofed or cloned without ever needed access to your or your hardware.
                        Email is also considered insecure, due both to insufficient encryption and the fact that for most people, it's hosted by a third-party service.
                        It doesn't help that the email account may also be compromised with the same credentials as from the account using MFA. Do not reuse passwords.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-3">
                        If possible, use hardware tokens for MFA, such as a <strong>YubiKey</strong> or the <strong>Google Titan Security Key</strong>. These are things you have to purchase, once, and you should probably
                        purchase a spare. Sites and services that allow you to register hardware tokens generally let you register multiple. This means you can keep one on your keychain
                        so it's always with you, and another located in a safe place as a backup in case something happens to the primary one. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-3">
                        For convenience, you may wish to select hardware that allows for multiple means of connection, like USB-C for your laptop and NFC for your phone or tablet (though 
                        admittedly USB-C would probably work there, too.)
                        Unfortunately, there is a reason "sites and services that allow you to register hardware tokens" was specified. Many of the services that should be secured most,
                        such as banking, health, and government institutions, are the least likely to allow users to utilize hardware tokens. These services are likely to have email and
                        SMS MFA options alone, if at all.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-3">
                        The second most preferred, but far more widely available MFA option is a <strong>time-based one time password (OTP) authenticator app</strong>. The name sounds complicated, but
                        many options exist and registering usually just involves scanning a QR code with your phone camera from within the app and supplying the resulting (often six digit)
                        code to finalize the setup. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-3">
                        Once implemented, you will be prompted for a code from the authenticator application each time you log in, so you will need your phone
                        accessible to log into a site or service, even if you know your password. Most authentication apps allow the registered OTP site configuration to be exported or 
                        backed up online in case of lost or damaged hardware.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-3">
                    <strong>Some options include:</strong>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-3 space-y-2">
                        <li>AuthO</li>
                        <li>Duo Mobile</li>
                        <li>Google Authenticator</li>
                        <li>Okta</li>
                    </ul>
                        If no other options exist, a basic 2FA system utilizing email or SMS is still better than no MFA on the account at all.

                    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-3">
                        First, phishing scams are common in email, but may also occur via phone or text message, so you'll have to practice vigilance on all of your devices.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-3">
                        Second, don't just look at the sender of an email and assume it's real. Expand the sender details to the extent possible on your device or service.
                        Usually, there is a toggle you can use to see more information, like the actual email address of the sender, rather than the name they chose to use for their
                        outgoing mail, as well as other information like the service that sent it. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-3">
                        For example, you may get an email from "Chase Bank Fraud Department" with an email
                        address of "wife243@gmail.com" when you drill into the extra information. The email itself may look convincing, and you may need to look closely at the email
                        address, even when expanding the details. Some clever attackers will register domains that look similar to the ones they're mimicking in an attempt to fool you.
                        Don't click any links from goog1e.com, paypa1.com, or faceb00k.com, for example.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-3">
                        Third, any communication you get that requires immediate action, invokes a sense of urgency or fear, or comes from an unexpected source should immediately
                        arouse your suspicion. The goal with these communications is to get you to act without thinking things over. Do not click or follow links without verifying them first.
                        Usually, you can hover over a link to see the URL it points to, or you can right-click and copy the link address, or long click if on a mobile device, and then
                        paste the link into a text editor to see where it would have taken you. If someone claiming to be your cousin emails you saying they're in another country and
                        urgently need money to get back, call them using the contact information you already have to verify. If you get an email saying your account will be closed unless
                        you take action, go to the actual company site and see if they mention anything out of the ordinary.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-3">
                        Fourth, don't open attachments from unknown senders, or if any of the factors above are present. Malicious attachments are often designed to be intriguing. Don't open the
                        "invoice," "court summons," or "evidence," no matter how much you want to prove your innocence or see what someone else is in trouble for or has purchased.

                        Encrypt your internet connection when using public Wi-Fi networks to protect your data from eavesdropping.
                        If you travel frequently, it might be worth investing in a travel router. These can be used to connect to public or hotel wifi or wired connections
                        and supply a different, secured network to which your devices can connect.

                    <p class="text-gray-600">
                        Store important files on external drives or cloud services. This protects you against data loss due to cyberattacks, hardware failure, or accidents.
                        Back up data routinely, on different mediums, and in separate locations. It doesn't matter that you backed up to both your network attached storage and
                        an external hard drive if they're both in the same burning house. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-3">
                        If your storage solutions offer the option, restrict artifact deletion for a period of time,
                        starting at one week. This will temporarily use more storage, but prevents files from being overridden or deleted in ransomware or other malicious attacks.
                        If all of your data is encrypted or deleted by a bad actor, it doesn't matter if it was stored and accessible elsewhere. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-3">
                        Additionally, ensure your online data
                        is encrypted locally before being uploaded to the storage provider, so if the service is ever compromised, attackers can't access your files. If you want to
                        backup your data online, but also don't expect to download said data very often, search for "cold storage" options among the typical vendors as this can save
                        you a significant amount of money, especially over time, which is the whole goal.

                    <p class="text-gray-600">
                        Periodically check and adjust privacy settings on social media, apps, and online services to control who sees your personal information.
                        If you especially trust a company and want to supply telemetry data, go for it. The company will appreciate it, although not enough to compensate you for it.
                        Otherwise, whenever possible disable public access to your account, or your private information at least, wherever possible. These settings might be updated
                        over time and warrant annual review. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-3">
                        Also take the time to select "necessary only" when presented with cookie settings online. Companies generally do not
                        need to store advertising and tracking data on your system for their sites to work, hence why those other categories are all unnecessary.

                    <p class="text-gray-600">
                        Change default router passwords, enable WPA3/WPA2 encryption, and consider creating guest and/or internet of things (IoT) networks.
                        Take this a step further by also changing the default password for all the smart devices in your home connecting over wifi.
                        IoT devices represent another attack surface as they regularly call home and could be conscripted by bad actors if vulnerabilities are left unpatched.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-3">
                        Some of these devices may not be supported by the original vendor anymore and will never receive the security updates needed to keep them secure.
                        Having them on a separate wifi network limits the risk they pose while allowing them to provide the functionality they promised.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-3">
                        Whenever possible, change the administrator username used to log onto your devices. "Admin" and "root" are common defaults, and if they can be disabled and
                        a replacement used, then attackers won't even know the username to use, much less the password.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-3">
                        Lastly, and this is slightly more technical, but don't use the default DNS settings you get from your Internet Service Provider (ISP).  The Domain Name System, DNS, 
                        translates human-readable website names into IP addresses to which your browser can connect.  "Google.com" is much easier to remember than "142.250.115.139."  
                        For most people, they will use the DNS settings automatically provided by their ISP, but this means your ISP knows every website to which you navigate, and 
                        often compile and sell this information.

                    <p class="text-gray-600">
                        There are a number of alternative public domain servers you can use, the most common being hosted by Google and Cloudflare.  You can set this in your router settings, 
                        assuming you know how to log into it and are comfortable changing network settings.
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-3">
                        <strong>Public DNS servers:</strong>
                        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-3 space-y-2">
                            <li>Cloudflare DNS: 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1</li>
                            <li>Google DNS: 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4</li>
                            <li>OpenDNS: 208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220</li>

                        </ul>
                        Any of these will work, and some even support encrypted DNS, so no one snooping can see what site's you're requesting.  You can set this at your router, so everyone 
                        connected to your network benefits, but you can also configure DNS on your individual device so your DNS preference is honored even when you travel.   You may also 
                        see some performance improvements, especially on public networks like in hotels or coffee shop wifi.  If you are already connecting to a VPN on public networks, it 
                        already encrypts all your traffic, including DNS requests, so you don't need to do both in that scenario.  To take it all a step further, you can stand up your own 
                        DNS server using low power hardware like a Raspberry Pi and software like PiHole or AdGuard.  It's out of scope for this resource, but these can help you filter ads, 
                        block inappropriate sites, and generally help safeguard you from various browser based threats online.

                    <p class="text-gray-600">
                        Since you're now using a password manager (right!?), you don't have to remember usernames, either.
                        This means you can implement another layer of security with something called plus addressing,
                        or subaddressing, available from most email providers.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-3">
                        An option you may not know you have is to add a plus sign (+) and a tag in your email address,
                        just to the left of the @ symbol. For example, if you are signing up for Bob's newsletter,
                        and your email address is "username@example.com," you can often choose to sign up using
                        "username+bobsnews@example.com" and the email will still be delivered to you like normal.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2 text-gray-800">Okay, weird, but so what?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">
                        Plus addressing is useful in a number of ways. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-3">
                        First, if you sign up for something and later start getting noticeably more spam email,
                        you can check the email address they're sending it to in order to potentially see who leaked (sold) it.
                        If you're getting spam sent to username+bobsnews@example.com, then you'll know it was Bob's newsletter that either
                        sold your information or was potentially compromised themselves.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-3">
                        Second, it helps for creating filters and rules in your email. Maybe you want to send all emails sent to
                        username+newsletters@example.com to a specific folder in your inbox so you don't get phone notifications.
                        Or maybe, Bob really did leak your email and you want to sent all email to "username+bobsnews@example.com"
                        directly to the trash.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-3">
                        Lastly, since we're talking security here, bad actors are buying credentials in bulk and running their scams largely
                        with automation. If the username and password are both unique, then it certainly won't work with the bad actor tries
                        to log in to your bank's website using the "username+bobsnews@example.com" username. If someone is targeting you specifically,
                        they'll likely catch on to the subaddressing, but most bad actors are just going after the low-hanging fruit.  It's also worth 
                        noting that not all online services allow the plus symbol in the email address field during registration, and will block 
                        it with input validation.
