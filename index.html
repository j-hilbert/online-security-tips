                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-indigo-700">1. Use Strong, Unique Passwords</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">
                        Never reuse passwords. Use a reputable password manager to generate and store complex, unique passwords
                        for each of your accounts.
                    </p>
                    <h3> Why?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">
                        The reason having a unique password for every account is so important is simple: You have no way of knowing how 
                        secure your account information is being protected when it is stored by a third party.  You may use a very strong 
                        password, but if you use it on all of your accounts, then if any vendor gets compromised, ALL of your accounts 
                        are compromised.  Enormous lists of leaked credentials are available online for bad actors to utilize.  Don't let 
                        the bad security practices of the gossip forum you joined in 2003 be the reason your bank account gets drained today.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">
                        Good passwords are hard to guess and not used anywhere else.   The best passwords are long, random text 
                        strings containing upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters.  More than just being 
                        hard to guess, these long, random, complex passwords also take a long time to brute force, and bad actors 
                        attempting to do so are more likely to be detected in the process.  As humans, we are not good at remembering 
                        large quantities of random passwords.  Since you should be using a unique password for every account, managing 
                        this yourself will get cumbersone very quickly.  Use a password manager.  They're worth every penny you might 
                        spend on them, and if you're a bit more techy, you can host your own for free.
                    </p>
                    <h3> Which one should I choose?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">
                        A good password manager stores only encrypted data, has abundant security mechanisms available to secure your personal 
                        information, and offers browser extensions and mobile apps that you can use to fill login credentials automatically as 
                        you need them.  The more convenient it is to use, the more likely you are to use it.  Because it allows access to ALL 
                        of your accounts, it is especially important that you secure it well.  Enable multifactor authentication at the very 
                        least.  More on that to come.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">
                        I like Bitwarden, personally, but there are many options available to choose from, including some from vendors you 
                        may already use.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Bitwarden:</strong><br>
                            A great open-source and free or affordable option, Bitwarden provides end-to-end encryption and a secure vault for 
                            storing sensitive information. It also offers browser extensions and mobile apps. 

                            <li><strong>1Password:</strong><br>
                                Known for its strong security and user-friendly interface, 1Password is a popular choice for individuals and 
                                businesses. It offers a wide range of features and robust security measures, including 2FA and local encryption. 

                        <li><strong>Dashlane:</strong><br>
                            Dashlane is known for its comprehensive feature set, including a VPN, password health checker, and dark web 
                            monitoring, in addition to strong security features like 2FA and 256-bit AES encryption. 

                        <li><strong>Keeper:</strong><br>
                            Keeper is lauded for its user-friendly interface and robust security features, including 2FA and a zero-knowledge 
                            security model where encryption and decryption happen on the user's device. 

                        <li><strong>NordPass:</strong><br>
                            This option is recognized for its strong encryption, user-friendly interface, and cross-platform capabilities. 

                        <li><strong><s>LastPass</s>:</strong><br>
                            I mention LastPass here mostly to preemptively answer the question, "What about LastPass?"  LastPass employees the 
                            features I mention above, but according to online sources, has a poor security track record, including but not 
                            limited to, a history of data breaches, unencrypted data exposure, questionable transparency, third-party audit 
                            concerns, and reports of crypto currency theft due to cracked user vaults exposing users' private keys.
                    </ul>

                    <h3> Are there any alternatives?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">
                        If you're not using a password manager, passphrases offer better security than passwords and are still easy to 
                        remember. While I wouldn't recommend using this one, "My password is P@ssword One Two Three!" is significantly 
                        more secure than "P@ssword123" but is just as easy to remember.

                        Add an extra layer of security to your accounts. Even if your password is stolen, 2FA
                        makes it significantly harder for unauthorized access.
